# Security - 

This is an example of a basic dictionary script that works on RAR and 7Zip files.  This is helpful if you forget the password to your file, and need to iterate through many of your most commonly used passwords quickly. 
This script does not automatically extract the file.  It is intended to quickly run through a wordlist and reveal the matching password.
